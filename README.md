The RS-WaterQuality Mapper is implemented as a plugin for QGIS 3.x using Python and the QGIS Application Programming Interface (API). The architecture of the plugin follows a modular, sequential workflow that guides users systematically through the necessary steps of a water quality analysis, from image data input, processing, to final map products. It provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) within QGIS. Once installed, it appears as a dockable panel with multiple tabs corresponding to the main steps of analysis: Generate Water Mask, Atmospheric Correction with ACOLITE, Calculate Spectral Indices from Image, Calculate Trophic State Index, Matching Pixel Values with Water Sample Points, Empirical Modeling, Spectral Clustering of Water Sample Points, Ensemble Component Model Calibration and Selection, Spectral-Space Partition and Ensemble Model Generation, Integrated Ensemble Modeling. The toolbox is designed around a logical, sequential workflow that guides the user through each necessary step of water quality analysis, from raw satellite data to final map product. Please refer to user manual on how to install and use the plugin.
